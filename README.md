It is a smart way to solve the problems of visually impaired persons. It can effectively solve all the problems that are faced by white cane. It can be easily carried anywhere. It is very useful for visually impaired persons who have problem with wrist, arm, shoulder and back. It is cost effective, production cost for making blind stick is expensive because it is made of different materials (metal tip, wood). Production cost for this wearable is much less than a white cane. Visually impaired persons experience difficulty in finding white cane at homes, smart wearable can solve it by using RF transmitter and receiver which can signal them with a buzzer sound.
